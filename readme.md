<h2>Chromaphagi</h2>
Chromaphagi is a cellular automata based image editing platform.
About.

Created by Peter Loyd in 2020, as a student at Seattle University.

Image I/O takes an image and puts it into a 3d array, with the z axis
representing RGB channels. Tasks: check to see if image is there, load it,
turn it into an array, save it.

The image is then treated with cellular automata, which work until a certain
point and then stop. The CA take a certain color, and move it in a particular
direction. 

When the CA are done, the image is saved.
